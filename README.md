# wafer-map-active-learning
This is the code for our paper:
Active Learning of Convolutional Neural Network for Cost-Effective Wafer Map Pattern Classification, IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 2020.

## How to run it
make the preprocessed data with read_data.py
and you can start an experiment using run_topk_div_val.py
